<p>Recently I received a mail pointing me to a post about DevOps culture and some anti-patterns and misconception on how to build and grow a DevOps culture in a company. Whoever like me works in the Enterprise (&ldquo;the one with the big E&rdquo; - Kelsey Hightower) knows that applying DevOps practices often is limited to the adoption of some tools or the creation of a &ldquo;DevOps team&rdquo; responsible of managing some continuous delivery pipeline. I would like to share my personal experience and possibly explain what to show to your boss when he thinks they are doing DevOps right.</p>

<p>Luckily for me I had the chance to work 5 years in a small company before DevOps was a thing: we were a small team and were forced to handle development and operations together, scaling our services in feature and size was becoming impossible without the use of some practices that a few years later we discovered was called &ldquo;DevOps&rdquo;.
When I changed job for an Enterprise company I was happy because I thought I would go and find a better implementation of the same practices, with people trained better than me to handle complex build and deployment systems; I actually found that a deployment system was not there and I was hired to help build one. My delusion was high because there was nothing for me to learn in there, I was stepping back into 3 years of work done automating JVM delivery with Jenkins.
At the very same time the higher management wanted desperately to implement a DevOps organization because studies was talking about how it could increase team productivity and reduce the time to market of features. So this decisions were made:</p>

<ul>
<li>a dedicated DevOps team was created to take care of the automation of the build/deployment process (at that time 100% manual)</li>
<li>a set of tools was chosen by the management and dictated to be used for monitoring, configuration management, etc&hellip;</li>
<li>no change to the rest of organization was made: developers department and operations department kept the very same separate structure</li>
<li>no change on how the software was developed: waterfall methodology was not removed</li>
</ul>

<p>Then once the automation of the release was almost complete and some of the hot-sounding technologies on the market (Ansible, Packer, Terraform) were used by some team members the company declared that &ldquo;through DevOps&rdquo; they could be the best in breed. The DevOps button was pressed!</p>

<p>There is enough literature around (see bottom of page) to have a common understanding on what a DevOps culture is, how it originated and the practices that make it powerful for modern application delivery; I think most of Enterprise companies struggle impementing a DevOps model because the higher management do not understand what the DevOps transformation requires: a complete rethinking of people, processes and organization. The technological tools that end up implemented in successful organizations implementing DevOps are only a consequence of such change, not the fuel of the change itself.
You cannot switch from SVN to Git, install Jenkins and Gradle and call yourself a DevOps company for doing that.</p>

<p>There is no silver bullet, there is no one-size-fits-all solution; DevOps is about empowering people to understand continuous improvement and the value of collaboration. There is so much confusion in the higher management of the Enterprise companies that <a href="https://puppet.com/resources/whitepaper/2016-state-of-devops-report">just changing your job title into &ldquo;DevOps Engineer&rdquo; will grant you a salary increase</a> (happened to me).</p>

<p>Take your stand for a truly cohesive organization that put &ldquo;people over processes over tools&rdquo; and find the courage to change, experiment and fail. This is what DevOps is about. Or you can keep doing it wrong.</p>
