# Interests and Hobbies
I play drums quite well and bass guitar at a low level, I listen to lots of music and I am trying to expand my musical culture more and more, with discs from the 70s-80s and also contemporary artists. I love running, it makes me feel free, and enjoy swimming in pool and sea.
