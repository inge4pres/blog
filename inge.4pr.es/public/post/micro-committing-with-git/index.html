  <h1>Micro-committing with Git</h1>
  <p>I have been using micro-committing for some time now, during which I have adapted the usage of this technique to my needs,
bringing it to a level that makes me more productive than ever in software development.</p>
<p>Combining micro-committing with Git, while doing <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_driven_development">TDD</a>
is now my favorite development experience: I like how this workflow helps to deliver changes with speed and confidence.</p>
<p>This is not a one-size-fits-all approach, I&rsquo;m sharing what works great <em>for me</em>; I hope some parts of what follows
will help you and your team as well.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-micro-committing">What is micro-committing?</h3>
<p>Despite micro-commits are not new, there is not much literature or a formal definition of it.
The concept is very simple: when developing or refactoring, use the SCM <em>at every notable step</em> creating a small commit.</p>
<p>Sizing properly micro-commits is what takes more practice mastering: I think it&rsquo;s a very personal thing, one might be comfortable
with lots of very tiny commits, some other with slightly larger bundles of changes, the important factor is usability.</p>
<p>We want to store in a commit every relevant code that produces an increment towards a goal.</p>
<h5 id="why-should-you-care">Why should you care?</h5>
<p>I found that using micro-commits makes working iteratively safer: the confidence I gain in adding or changing code once
I am backed by a <em>&ldquo;diffable history&rdquo;</em>, is priceless.</p>
<p>Keeping track of changes at a smaller rate enables to move back and forth into history to do local optimizations.
Having these changes recorded with Git might not be useful <em>all the time</em>, but when they&rsquo;re needed they are going
to be very valuable.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-make-the-best-out-of-it">How to make the best out of it</h3>
<p>In theory, the smaller the change bundle recorded in every commit, the better!
While keeping a long list of tiny changes locally can have several benefits, it can also turn your review process and CI
pipelines into chaos.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we need to be careful in managing micro-commits not only during coding but also when preparing changes to
be submitted for peer review.</p>
<h4 id="during-development">During development</h4>
<p>During the development phase we want to store locally as many micro-commits as we need to ensure that we can easily
move our code back to a working revision. When the development is completed we don&rsquo;t want to send the micro-commits
to the remote repository, because reviewing that history would be difficult.</p>
<p>With these concepts in mind, below the things to remember when mirco-committing during the development of new features.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>never</strong> push to the remote repository until the commit history has been reviewed</li>
</ul>
<p>One thing that I learnt recently thanks to my <a href="#credits">amazing colleagues</a> is that Git history is precious.
We don&rsquo;t want to pollute the tree with too many commits targeting the same feature.
Micro-commits are an aid for <em>local</em> development: they should be squashed, rewritten and edited before sending them
into a remote repository (more on this below).</p>
<ul>
<li>add a micro-commit for every development iteration unit: every test assertion added, every successful implementation and
refactoring</li>
</ul>
<p>We want that every change with a significant impact on the codebase can be consistently fetched.
Any IDE Undo/Redo feature does kind of the same, but a micro-commit plays better with refactoring, for example when
changing a signature or renaming a package.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to store in a micro-commit changes that do not have a &ldquo;business&rdquo; meaning, like renaming a variable.
At the same time we don&rsquo;t want to store in a micro-commit several changes that map to multiple features: doing so would
prevent us to go back in time with fine-grained control, and thus lose the benefits or incremental history.</p>
<ul>
<li>write a short but meaningful commit message: we must be able to understand what we did</li>
</ul>
<p>Optionally, include in the commit message the name of the component or sub-system under change.
When re-reading the history of commits, it will be helpful to know which commits are part of which
bundle of changes.</p>
<ul>
<li>create a tag when a cycle of development or refactoring is complete, but delete it before pushing
(in summary, never push tags used for referencing micro-commits)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not strictly required: I like to create a simple, non-annotated tag, with the name of the task when I declare
it completed. It helps me to point a commit to a task completion in the Git log.
Adding a tag can be replaced by details in the commit message: we need to be able to understand which commit resolved
a given task.</p>
<ul>
<li>when you are stuck, throw everything away and go back to last commit!</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where this technique really shines: firing up a single command</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>git reset --hard
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>will allow to re-start from what <em>you</em> chose minutes ago as a standing point, a safe place from which a new iteration can start.
If you create tags as in the previous bullet, you can even jump multiple micro-commits back, correcting a wider design
mistake or a faulty implementation with a newer idea, just specify the tag name you want to <code>reset</code> to.</p>
<h4 id="preparing-for-peer-review">Preparing for peer review</h4>
<p>It is important to review the Git history before submitting it to the remote repository: we should group multiple
micro-commits belonging to the same task into a single commit.</p>
<p>The reasons for doing so:</p>
<ol>
<li>peer-review done commit by commit helps reviewers understanding more than the code logic, enriching code with
the <em>rationale</em> and the decisions made by the author</li>
<li>reverting a single feature should be as easy as reverting a single commit (or a few of them): reducing the
cognitive load embedded in the history helps when things go wrong, even if all tests had passed üòÅ</li>
</ol>
<p>A good way to achieve a clean history, ready for being reviewed, is with an <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase"><strong>interactive rebase</strong></a>
to the target branch.
This is the most straightforward way to create a meaningful list of commits that can tell a story about the development
being shipped.</p>
<p>When rebasing interactively, you are presented the list of commits you are going to add on top of the target branch in an
editor. From there it&rsquo;s possible to merge (<code>squash</code>, <code>fixup</code>), remove (<code>drop</code>) and even change the order of commits!</p>
<p>I use these 3 steps to craft the intended Git history:</p>
<ol>
<li>remove tags used as references to micro-commits</li>
</ol>
<p>In most CI systems tied to the Git tree, tags can trigger special workflows like creating artifacts for releases:
we don&rsquo;t want this.</p>
<p>If tags have been created to keep track of multiple features, I&rsquo;ll remove them to avoid accidentally pushing them
and triggering such workflows.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>squash</code> or <code>fixup</code> corrections and clean-up commits to the uppermost relevant commit</li>
</ol>
<p>It is good to remove commits that were useful during local development, but do not have a tangible impact for the
reviewers: i.e. linting corrections, typos in documentation, etc&hellip; These commits should always be conflated with a previous one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also possible to move commits up and down during an interactive rebase, but note that it can lead to difficulties in
setting up the desired history: you might end up in conflicts that will counter-effect the benefits of micro-committing,
with time lost on editing during the rebase.</p>
<ol>
<li>set the commit that is the union of multiple fixup/squash commits with a <code>reword</code></li>
</ol>
<p>In this way, Git will open the editor to revrite the commit message.
A commit that will be in the history of a repository needs to be explicit about what&rsquo;s being committed.
It has to contain a good high-level description of what it holds in all its parts.</p>
<p>Remember the famous jewelery slogan <em>&ldquo;a diamond is forever&rdquo;</em>? A valid statement is also <strong>&ldquo;a commit is forever&rdquo;</strong>
(at least it should be!) üòâ.</p>

<p>Micro-committing is very helpful to collaborate effectively on a project, it can be tedious in first instance and apparently the benefits are not tangible,
though adopting it will be very valuable in some occasions.</p>
<p>Try to practice it stick with mataining a clean Git history, then ask for feedback to the people collaborating with you on the repository.</p>
