  <h1><a href="https://inge.4pr.es/post/continuous-delivery-with-drone/">Continuous Delivery with Drone</a></h1>
  <p>Continuous Delivery should be a solved issue: the practice is well-defined and there is a plethora of tools implementing it with more or less peculiarities, but still many struggle implementing it. The dream of a perfect continuous deployment flow from the developer to the production environment with software quality gates based on automated tests is still alive in me, I tried and tried several times with multiple implementations on multiple platforms and never got to the point where I could say: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m done, this works exactly as I wanted&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So I stumbled on <a href="https://drone.io">drone</a> and decided to give it a go: it&rsquo;s an open-source project, written in Go and with a SaaS offering via their website. The concept I like is that every step of the build/deployment process runs through a container and this is very close to my idea of a modern CD tool, a platform where I can compose pipelines by chaining containers execution on a shared workspace. Love it already.</p>
<h3 id="installing-the-stack">Installing the stack</h3>
<p>You can run the drone server and agent locally on your laptop with <code>docker-compose</code> as detailed <a href="http://docs.drone.io/installation/">here</a>. Only issue is: for integrating with any of the big Git cloud provider (Github and Gitlab) you will need to expose your service to the internet, so I&rsquo;ll use a local instance of <a href="https://gogs.io/">gogs</a> running in a docker container from the <a href="https://github.com/gogits/gogs/tree/master/docker">official image</a>. All I need is in the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file: I added just a couple of <code>volumes</code> directive compared to the <a href="http://docs.drone.io/install-for-gogs/">original one</a> and I am using the docker-for-mac internal hostname to resolve the bridge IP internally as detailed <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/networking/#use-cases-and-workarounds">here</a>. This is a lab setup and having a production-ready installation will require database setup and filesystem persistence, but I don&rsquo;t have this requirement now. After a <code>docker-compose up -d</code> my stack is ready.</p>
<h4 id="installing-the-cli">Installing the CLI</h4>
<p>As easy as following <a href="http://docs.drone.io/cli-installation/">this guide</a>. Once logged to the web UI I navigate to the <code>${DRONE_HOST}/account/token</code> page where I can get a token to configure the CLI.</p>
<h3 id="adding-secrets">Adding secrets</h3>
<p>There is a nice feature in drone: I can <a href="http://docs.drone.io/manage-secrets/">manage secrets</a> directly from the command line and they can be scoped globally or be available only to one pipeline step (corresponding to an image). I will need to add Dockerhub username and password to the <code>plugin/docker</code> image to be able to push the image, so I add this 2 secrets with the following</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>drone secret add -repository=inge/goapp -image=plugins/docker -name=docker_username -value=inge4pres
drone secret add -repository=inge/goapp -image=plugins/docker -name=docker_password -value=***************
</code></pre><h3 id="a-sample-pipeline">A sample pipeline</h3>
<p>As many of the continuous delivery tools available on the market, drone uses a YAML configuration file in the root of the repository, so adding a <code>.drone.yml</code> hidden file is enough to start hooking every commit to the build system. I configured a <a href="https://github.com/inge4pres/blog/blob/master/continuous-delivery-with-drone/test-app/.drone.yml">3 stages pipeline</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>test and build artifact</li>
<li>publish the artifact</li>
<li>deploy the application</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s very simple to get started and the one-container-per-step architecture makes it trivial to glue together multiple steps. There is an implicit concept of <a href="http://docs.drone.io/workspace/">shared workspace (configurable)</a> that you can leverage to use Makefile and Dockerfile just as the build was happening on your local environment.</p>
<p>So I really recommend trying out drone and reporting some issues if you find any, for the time being I am very excited to have a CD product entirely written in Go - I think I will contribute to the project to have some enhancements available in the free version.</p>
<p>Below here some screenshots of the drone web UI and the pipeline resulting from the YAML config file: I will explore more complex workflows like <a href="http://docs.drone.io/promoting-builds/">promoted builds</a> and <a href="http://docs.drone.io/gated-builds/">gated builds</a> - and build more in the tool if I need.</p>

  <h1><a href="https://inge.4pr.es/post/2017-05-28-devops-you-re-doing-it-wrong/">DevOps: you&#39;re doing it wrong</a></h1>
  <p>Recently I received a mail pointing me to a post about DevOps culture and some anti-patterns and misconception on how to build and grow a DevOps culture in a company. Whoever like me works in the Enterprise (&ldquo;the one with the big E&rdquo; - Kelsey Hightower) knows that applying DevOps practices often is limited to the adoption of some tools or the creation of a &ldquo;DevOps team&rdquo; responsible of managing some continuous delivery pipeline. I would like to share my personal experience and possibly explain what to show to your boss when he thinks they are doing DevOps right.</p>
<p>Luckily for me I had the chance to work 5 years in a small company before DevOps was a thing: we were a small team and were forced to handle development and operations together, scaling our services in feature and size was becoming impossible without the use of some practices that a few years later we discovered was called &ldquo;DevOps&rdquo;.
When I changed job for an Enterprise company I was happy because I thought I would go and find a better implementation of the same practices, with people trained better than me to handle complex build and deployment systems; I actually found that a deployment system was not there and I was hired to help build one. My delusion was high because there was nothing for me to learn in there, I was stepping back into 3 years of work done automating JVM delivery with Jenkins.
At the very same time the higher management wanted desperately to implement a DevOps organization because studies was talking about how it could increase team productivity and reduce the time to market of features. So this decisions were made:</p>
<ul>
<li>a dedicated DevOps team was created to take care of the automation of the build/deployment process (at that time 100% manual)</li>
<li>a set of tools was chosen by the management and dictated to be used for monitoring, configuration management, etc&hellip;</li>
<li>no change to the rest of organization was made: developers department and operations department kept the very same separate structure</li>
<li>no change on how the software was developed: waterfall methodology was not removed</li>
</ul>
<p>Then once the automation of the release was almost complete and some of the hot-sounding technologies on the market (Ansible, Packer, Terraform) were used by some team members the company declared that &ldquo;through DevOps&rdquo; they could be the best in breed. The DevOps button was pressed!</p>
<p>There is enough literature around (see bottom of page) to have a common understanding on what a DevOps culture is, how it originated and the practices that make it powerful for modern application delivery; I think most of Enterprise companies struggle impementing a DevOps model because the higher management do not understand what the DevOps transformation requires: a complete rethinking of people, processes and organization. The technological tools that end up implemented in successful organizations implementing DevOps are only a consequence of such change, not the fuel of the change itself.
You cannot switch from SVN to Git, install Jenkins and Gradle and call yourself a DevOps company for doing that.</p>
<p>There is no silver bullet, there is no one-size-fits-all solution; DevOps is about empowering people to understand continuous improvement and the value of collaboration. There is so much confusion in the higher management of the Enterprise companies that <a href="https://puppet.com/resources/whitepaper/2016-state-of-devops-report">just changing your job title into &ldquo;DevOps Engineer&rdquo; will grant you a salary increase</a> (happened to me).</p>
<p>Take your stand for a truly cohesive organization that put &ldquo;people over processes over tools&rdquo; and find the courage to change, experiment and fail. This is what DevOps is about. Or you can keep doing it wrong.</p>
