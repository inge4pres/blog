  <p>The last weekend my colleagues and I had a nice time moving an existing application from a bare-metal infrastructure to AWS. I would like to share some of the focal points involved in such process, in case you&#8217;d go through it and would like to know:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>don&#8217;t expect everything to work as usual</strong>: you are changing the underlying hardware, moving to a virtualized environment. You can test every single part of the application but infrastructural side effects may occur in a second time</li>
<li><strong>relying on the provider</strong>: consider well which functionalities should be delegated to the cloud provider (AWS, in this case, offers a lot) or should be managed internally; for example S3 is not a distributed filesystem, and in some cases an RDS instance won&#8217;t have the same performance as database installed on an EC2 instance</li>
<li><strong>test application compliance, not hardware failure</strong>: instead of focusing on stress tests, you should focus first on functionality tests to ensure every part of te application is behaving as expected; hardware failure are easily handled in the cloud, that&#8217;s the primary purpose of IaaS. What is not handled by the cloud is that the application&#8217;s features will work on it!</li>
<li><strong>use a checklist</strong>: this may seem obvious, but having a clear and well written to-do list with a time table and activities&#8217; details will help you analyze if anything is missing or needs to be done in advance</li>
</ul>

<p>Aside of this technical considerations, having the support of your coworkers and managers it is what really makes the difference: it keeps you focused in every step and at the same time helps if any problem comes up. That&#8217;s why my boss decided to take several videos with his phone and produced a &#8220;movie&#8221;,Â Â hope you like it ðŸ˜€</p>
