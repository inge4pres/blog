#### Bio

I'm a passionate technology enthusiast, a Systems Engineer in love with Cloud Computing and a part-time musician and writer; I became a Go developer on 2013 when approaching distributed systems. I like to study how things work, understand the mechanics of technology products. In my spare time I play drums, bass guitar and acoustic guitar, and sometimes try and write some music; writing small poems is also interesting to me, as it helps me find a different meaning for anything I see.

#### Background

I attended Scientific High School, graduated in Industrial Engineering at Politecnico Milano and started working in Computer Science a few months later. I really feel thankful towards my college education because it introduced me to the real world side of science, computing and mathematics above all, then Open Source, curiosity and love for music did the rest. I worked several years as self-taught audio engineer: I really enjoyed helping people find the best possible sound.
