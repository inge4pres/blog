      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m more and more fond of finding the perfect solution to manage application delivery: dev teams want to be fast but their ops counterpart is not happy to loose control over the growing number of deployments that could cause an outage. We as an industry need to find the right balance to have features delivered in time and keep the service up and running for our users! And that&amp;rsquo;s where progressive delivery can help!</description>

      <description>Recently I received a mail pointing me to a post about DevOps culture and some anti-patterns and misconception on how to build and grow a DevOps culture in a company. Whoever like me works in the Enterprise (&amp;ldquo;the one with the big E&amp;rdquo; - Kelsey Hightower) knows that applying DevOps practices often is limited to the adoption of some tools or the creation of a &amp;ldquo;DevOps team&amp;rdquo; responsible of managing some continuous delivery pipeline.</description>
