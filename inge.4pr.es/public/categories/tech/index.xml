In a previous post we saw an NGINX configuration to allow gRPC traffic mirroring.
Is the same technique applicable on Kubernetes? Yes! Using the ingress-nginx ingress controller!
Traffic mirroring Use the following configurations snippets in the ingress-nginx configMap and in the Ingress manifest to mirror all traffic to a separate gRPC server.
ConfigMap Replace grpc-backend.company.net and grpc-mirror.company.net with the original and mirror endpoint, respectively.
http-snippet: | server { listen 127.</description>

Recently at work with the Optimyze team we faced the necessity of copying traffic from our current customer-facing environment to a new environment. We have assumptions and ideas about architectural changes that cannot be validated only with synthetic tests and require cloning traffic to a separate, internal testing environment.
There is no better test than the one performed with real-world data: when you hear speaking about testing in production, a deployment of a new feature to &amp;ldquo;see what happens&amp;rdquo; is not what I have in mind.</description>

      <description>I have been using micro-committing for some time now, during which I have adapted the usage of this technique to my needs, bringing it to a level that makes me more productive than ever in software development.
Combining micro-committing with Git, while doing TDD is now my favorite development experience: I like how this workflow helps to deliver changes with speed and confidence.
This is not a one-size-fits-all approach, I&amp;rsquo;m sharing what works great for me; I hope some parts of what follows will help you and your team as well.</description>

      <description>Yes! Yesterday I received an awesome email stating that I cleared the Certified Kubernetes Administrator exam! 😎 Here I want to report my experience in preparing and taking the exam, hopefully this info can help others Kubernetes practitioners get the certification too.
Preparation I consider myself lucky because for the past two years I had the chance to use Kubernetes working at lastminute.com; on top this on-the-job training I went through a lot of studying and practicing because the exam itself has a lot of content.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m more and more fond of finding the perfect solution to manage application delivery: dev teams want to be fast but their ops counterpart is not happy to loose control over the growing number of deployments that could cause an outage. We as an industry need to find the right balance to have features delivered in time and keep the service up and running for our users! And that&amp;rsquo;s where progressive delivery can help!</description>

      <description>Cloud-native: sounds attractive right? What does it even mean? Wikipedia has no page on it already so anyone can give its own definition&amp;hellip; Here&amp;rsquo;s mine:
A Cloud-native application has only concern on the functionalities that it has to deliver as it is completely decoupled from the infrastructure it runs on
So how can software delivery be cloud-native? Isn&amp;rsquo;t software delivery supposed to &amp;ldquo;install&amp;rdquo; software onto some infrastructure? Well if your infrastructure provider is cloud-native, you can transitively deliver software on it in a cloud-native way (counts of cloud-native is over 9000, so stopping here)!</description>

      <description>Continuous Delivery should be a solved issue: the practice is well-defined and there is a plethora of tools implementing it with more or less peculiarities, but still many struggle implementing it. The dream of a perfect continuous deployment flow from the developer to the production environment with software quality gates based on automated tests is still alive in me, I tried and tried several times with multiple implementations on multiple platforms and never got to the point where I could say: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m done, this works exactly as I wanted&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>In the early days of Go the language was often tailored towards &amp;ldquo;system programming&amp;rdquo; due to its C-stlye syntax and ability to write high-performance applications. Few time after, Go adoption was starting to gain traction for distributed systems development and projects like etcd, docker and kubernetes revealed the power of the networking capabilities offered by the internals in the language. Along the way a lot of libraries have been built around the powerful primitives offered by Go but in my opinion there is not enough use literature around the Communicating Sequential Processes implementation available through channels and goroutines, they are not even widely used in the standard library.</description>

      <description>One of the advantages of containerized applications is the standardization, some would say &amp;ldquo;write it once, runs everywhere&amp;rdquo; but that&amp;rsquo;s another motto for another product. Anyway with a new packaging technology the same problems are faced: build reproducibility, or the necessity for people doing Ops to know they are going to deploy the same exact piece of code the Dev team used in their tests. So to address this issue the container image needs to be immutable: once it&amp;rsquo;s built, it&amp;rsquo;s not going to be changed, ever.</description>

      <description>Letsencrypt is cool: automated, free TLS certificates for everybody! They are sponsored mainly by internet corps and they started a crowd-funding campaign to avoid the influence of this corps in the future of the project. I recently moved the blog to hugo on AWS and I&amp;rsquo;m now porting the TLS management scripts I wrote a while ago on AWS: this is a nice exercise to give a proper TLS automation valid for everyone on AWS.</description>

      <description>Last month I felt I was a little late for the #serverless party going on all over the internet and I started taking a look at what the pros and cons would be to actually not manage any server myself. Shutting down my VPS hosting my apps I will lose my mail server, my MySQL instances and my Docker registry but: who cares? There are cloud services I can use with hundreds of times more availability and for a fraction of the cost.</description>

So instead of a bare VPS I am moving my blog to AWS S3 + Cloudfront CDN. This will be more scalable and far less expensive.</description>

      <description>Amazon Web Services Elastic File System has been to my knowledge the service to have the longest beta testing period: reason for this may be that not as many client as expected tested it and AWS received too few feedback on it or that there were issues not to release GA. I don’t want to speculate on which one is correct but now that it has been officially released I decided to give it a try and of course compare it to a self-managed solution on the same platform.</description>

      <description>If you’re an AWS administrator you know that managing web console security is pretty tough unless you know what you want and you know what you’re doing. So if what you want is let each AWS user manage their own MFA device configuration without you and force them to have MFA active to use the web console, here is your solution.
TL;DR
Create one or more groups with your web users Create a new policy using this JSON Attach the policy to the group(s) How does it work?</description>

      <title>Implement a generic data list structure</title>

      <description>As a coding challenge I was asked to provide a generic list implementation using a language of my choice and using only primitive types, avoiding the use of high level built-ins. I chose Go because I want to learn it and I know it can be useful to create an abstract, generic implementation.
The challenge request to implement at least 4 methods on the generic type:
Filter() – returns a subset of the List satisfying an operation Map() – returns the List objects’ map Reverse() – reverse the ordering of the List objects FoldLeft() – join the objects from left to right using a join character As a bonus question I was asked to code unit tests for the aforementioned methods and give an explanation on how the implementation guarantees concurrent access on resources.</description>

      <description>A friend asked me if I was able to get back working a Windows 98 PC he had in his house; I have never done it so I said “sure I can!” just to have the opportunity to learn something new, and of course do a friend a favour.
My idea was to copy the whole PC and get it running on a virtual machine thus doing what I later discovered is called a “P2V” (Physical to Virtual); the result of which would have been a portable VM which I could then install in my friend laptop to have his old PC back.</description>

Being a cloud system engineer, my work is to design and implement distributed systems: one of the key principles in designing such architectures is decoupling, which means ensuring the many parts composing the system are able to share informations and complete a sequence of operations without being tied together.</description>

      <description>It is true: I fell in love with Go, not because I love Google and his products, but because it really fits my ideology of simplicity and power in a programming language. I started experimenting with the language and thank to his web-oriented approach I quickly came up with one of the simplest single task web application I could write: a URL shortener.
What is a URL shortener? It’s a service that will give you a short link for a long URL.</description>

      <description>One of the very basic need of any startup is setting up a LAN in the workspace and configuring the Internet most used service: DNS. Relying on a public DNS may give you full functionality towards WAN connectivity, but when you need to address some hosts inside your LAN it can be handy to use names instead of IPs (especially with IPv6).
Here’s a straight forward guide to get you started with your private DNS in a few minutes.</description>

      <description>The last weekend my colleagues and I had a nice time moving an existing application from a bare-metal infrastructure to AWS. I would like to share some of the focal points involved in such process, in case you’d go through it and would like to know:
don’t expect everything to work as usual: you are changing the underlying hardware, moving to a virtualized environment. You can test every single part of the application but infrastructural side effects may occur in a second time relying on the provider: consider well which functionalities should be delegated to the cloud provider (AWS, in this case, offers a lot) or should be managed internally; for example S3 is not a distributed filesystem, and in some cases an RDS instance won’t have the same performance as database installed on an EC2 instance test application compliance, not hardware failure: instead of focusing on stress tests, you should focus first on functionality tests to ensure every part of te application is behaving as expected; hardware failure are easily handled in the cloud, that’s the primary purpose of IaaS.</description>

      <description>Here’s a thing I came up with: you’re administering a Linux system with 100 users circa and you’re moving to a new server, you can save crontabs per user with this:
mkdir crontabz &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cd crontabz; for user in `cat /etc/cron.allow`; do crontab -l -u $user &amp;gt; cron_$user; done
you will end up with a list of files cron_xxx, each one has the users’ cron. Hopefully your cron version will use the /etc/cron.</description>

I chose Zabbix to monitor my infrastructure because:
despite it’s a bit difficult to install (you need a PHP enabled web server, a database and a C compiler), you will benefit a very user-friendly web interface with lots of functionalities native agents for major OS release are already complied: FreeBSD, Linux, Windows, etc… Compiling to other OS just requires a “configure &amp;amp;&amp;amp; make &amp;amp;&amp;amp; make install” it offers many monitoring methods via a unique interface: you can group SNMP, JMX, HTTP monitoring in one shot it has multi-step HTTP/HTTPS monitoring, simulating different browsers and clients you can build nice infographics bundling all kind of monitored datas you can manage users and roles to give access to the web interface at your company’s employees you can build custom monitoring scripts to your needs Well let’s see some action now: I would like to post a short tutorial on how to build a custom script to monitor resources used by a Glassfish application server.</description>

      <description>Ieri in ufficio mi è capitata una disgrazia, una rara occasione in cui non c’è capacità o competenza che possano aiutarti a risolvere il caso, serve solo fortuna: nel pomeriggio rientro dalla sigaretta e mi sento dire “non abbiamo più rete”.
L’azienda dove lavoro si occupa di fornire servizi IT, senza la connessione internet siamo un’auto senza motore, una penna senza inchiostro, inutili.
La linea di backup?
All’inizio incolpo subito il nostro ISP (Fastweb), che a discapito di una fibra 100Mb ci ha giocato in passato scherzi del genere; quando la verifica evidenzia che non è un loro problema, il panico.</description>

      <description>Ho sempre vissuto in città di provincia (MI) dove è abitudine frequentare una cerchia ristretta di persone. Questo mi ha permesso di stringere legami molto forti con chi considero i miei amici, ma allo stesso tempo non mi ha favorito nello sviluppo di una sensibilità verso la gestione delle informazioni personali nella vita reale; la mia lingua lunga ha solo fatto piovere sul bagnato…
