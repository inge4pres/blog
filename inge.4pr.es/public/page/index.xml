      <description>Bio I&amp;rsquo;m a passionate technology enthusiast, an engineer in love with Computer Science and a part-time musician and writer; I started my career in IT as a sysadmin and became a Go developer in 2013 when approaching distributed systems. I like to study how things work, understand the mechanics of technology products. In my spare time I play drums, bass guitar and acoustic guitar, and sometimes try and write some music; writing small poems is also a passion of mine, as it helps me find a different meaning to things.</description>
