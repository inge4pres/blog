  <h1><a href="https://inge.4pr.es/post/2017-05-28-devops-you-re-doing-it-wrong/">DevOps: you&#39;re doing it wrong</a></h1>
  <p>Recently I received a mail pointing me to a post about DevOps culture and some anti-patterns and misconception on how to build and grow a DevOps culture in a company. Whoever like me works in the Enterprise (&ldquo;the one with the big E&rdquo; - Kelsey Hightower) knows that applying DevOps practices often is limited to the adoption of some tools or the creation of a &ldquo;DevOps team&rdquo; responsible of managing some continuous delivery pipeline. I would like to share my personal experience and possibly explain what to show to your boss when he thinks they are doing DevOps right.</p>
<p>Luckily for me I had the chance to work 5 years in a small company before DevOps was a thing: we were a small team and were forced to handle development and operations together, scaling our services in feature and size was becoming impossible without the use of some practices that a few years later we discovered was called &ldquo;DevOps&rdquo;.
When I changed job for an Enterprise company I was happy because I thought I would go and find a better implementation of the same practices, with people trained better than me to handle complex build and deployment systems; I actually found that a deployment system was not there and I was hired to help build one. My delusion was high because there was nothing for me to learn in there, I was stepping back into 3 years of work done automating JVM delivery with Jenkins.
At the very same time the higher management wanted desperately to implement a DevOps organization because studies was talking about how it could increase team productivity and reduce the time to market of features. So this decisions were made:</p>
<ul>
<li>a dedicated DevOps team was created to take care of the automation of the build/deployment process (at that time 100% manual)</li>
<li>a set of tools was chosen by the management and dictated to be used for monitoring, configuration management, etc&hellip;</li>
<li>no change to the rest of organization was made: developers department and operations department kept the very same separate structure</li>
<li>no change on how the software was developed: waterfall methodology was not removed</li>
</ul>
<p>Then once the automation of the release was almost complete and some of the hot-sounding technologies on the market (Ansible, Packer, Terraform) were used by some team members the company declared that &ldquo;through DevOps&rdquo; they could be the best in breed. The DevOps button was pressed!</p>
<p>There is enough literature around (see bottom of page) to have a common understanding on what a DevOps culture is, how it originated and the practices that make it powerful for modern application delivery; I think most of Enterprise companies struggle impementing a DevOps model because the higher management do not understand what the DevOps transformation requires: a complete rethinking of people, processes and organization. The technological tools that end up implemented in successful organizations implementing DevOps are only a consequence of such change, not the fuel of the change itself.
You cannot switch from SVN to Git, install Jenkins and Gradle and call yourself a DevOps company for doing that.</p>
<p>There is no silver bullet, there is no one-size-fits-all solution; DevOps is about empowering people to understand continuous improvement and the value of collaboration. There is so much confusion in the higher management of the Enterprise companies that <a href="https://puppet.com/resources/whitepaper/2016-state-of-devops-report">just changing your job title into &ldquo;DevOps Engineer&rdquo; will grant you a salary increase</a> (happened to me).</p>
<p>Take your stand for a truly cohesive organization that put &ldquo;people over processes over tools&rdquo; and find the courage to change, experiment and fail. This is what DevOps is about. Or you can keep doing it wrong.</p>

  <h1><a href="https://inge.4pr.es/post/2016-11-17-4pres-goes-serverless/">4pres goes #serverless</a></h1>
  <p>Last month I felt I was a little late for the <a href="https://charity.wtf/2016/05/31/wtf-is-operations-serverless/" title="#serverless">#serverless</a> party going on all over the internet and I started taking a look at what the pros and cons would be to actually not manage any server myself.
Shutting down my VPS hosting my apps I will lose my mail server, my MySQL instances and my Docker registry but: who cares? There are cloud services I can use with hundreds of times more availability and for a fraction of the cost.</p>
<h1 id="why-serverless">Why #serverless?</h1>
<p>We are moving more and more rapidly to a developer friendly world: all cloud providers tend to relief companies from the burden of managing complex cluster architectures and it&rsquo;s not a coincidence that things like <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/interview/ben-treynor.html" title="SRE at Google">SRE at Google</a> exist. Systadmins are no longer required where they can be substituted with far more performance by declarative syntax clusters (Kubernetes, Docker Data Center) and reliabile, consistent configuration deployment (Ansible, Puppet) in managing high volumes of phisycal or virtual machines.</p>
<p>This shift to a developer-centric world forces who embraces it to &ldquo;trust&rdquo; the IaaS, PaaS and FaaS providers but in the same time let them focus on core and valuable development processes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>Take the simplest app in the world: <a href="https://4pr.es">4pres</a>, a URL shortener. It needs a presentation, computation and data layer as most of apps. Traditionally and depending on your budget and needs, you would spin up one or more VPS and deploy software on them (containers or not, doesn&rsquo;t matter here). The setup of nginx as reverse proxy to your application already requires skills that most of developers don&rsquo;t have, but in first hand why should anybody have them when there is a service like AWS API Gateway that lets you deploy one in seconds?
Having the possiility to do so, you <em>may</em> want to forget about everything not strictly related to your app, so focusing only on building and maintaining functionalities of your app.</p>
<h1 id="how-you-can-migrate-your-app-today">How you can migrate your app today</h1>
<p>In terms of cloud provider I have a lot of experience with AWS therefore my first thought is for them when trying to do something like this: they probably already have enough mature services supporting what I need. Don&rsquo;t take this as a sponsorship: you can do the same with any other provider.</p>
<h4 id="traditional-architecture">Traditional Architecture</h4>
<ul>
<li>NGINX reverse proxy</li>
<li>Golang application</li>
<li>MySQL database</li>
</ul>
<p>NGINX terminates SSL and proxy back to app every request. The <a href="https://github.com/inge4pres/4pr.es" title="4pres/master">Golang app</a> finds out what to do from a combination of HTTP Method and URL Path:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>GET /</code> renders the landing page template</li>
<li><code>GET /{url}</code> queries the DB and redirect to long url or render 404 template</li>
<li><code>POST /</code> create a short link from <code>form-data url=http://alongurul/</code> and display the result template</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="serverless-architecture-aws">Serverless Architecture (AWS)</h4>
<ul>
<li>API Gateway expose a request/response mapping endpoint with integration to other services</li>
<li>S3 to store and serve the static content</li>
<li>Lambda executes Golang functions thanks to the amazing <a href="https://github.com/eawsy/aws-lambda-go" title="eawsy/aws-go-lambda">eawsy/aws-go-lambda</a> framework</li>
<li>DynamoDB stores data in schema-less fashion (JSON)</li>
</ul>
<p>The API Gateway definition acts as proxy and:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>GET /</code> serves static page <code>index.html</code> from S3 bucket with &lsquo;Website Hosting&rsquo; option enabled</li>
<li><code>GET /{url}</code> runs a Lamdba function <a href="https://github.com/inge4pres/4pr.es/blob/serverless/cmd/4pres_get/get.go" title="4pres_get">4pres_get</a> that fetches the URL Path parameter from DynamoDB and redirect the client or renders a 404 template</li>
<li><code>GET /s?{urlencodedURL}</code> runs a Lambda function <a href="https://github.com/inge4pres/4pr.es/blob/serverless/cmd/4pres_post/post.go" title="4pres_post">4pres_post</a> that creates a short URL and tries to store it in DynamoDB, returning the result template or the 500 template.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not that big change in the overall design, but the code for the Golang app only shares a function to shorten the URL between the 2 implementations: that is understandable because we no longer manage HTTP requests attributes and delegate that to API Gateway, we don&rsquo;t display static content anymore and leave that to S3. At the core we only have 2 things to worry about:</p>
<ul>
<li>store a URL (4pres_post)</li>
<li>get  URL to redirect the client</li>
</ul>
<p>and then we can focus on extending new features:</p>
<ul>
<li>URL expiration</li>
<li>user registration</li>
<li>whatever!</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Thanks to this development model our craftsmen effort can be 100% dedicated to building features and forget about the rest: this can be a great advantage at large scale. Recently I have come across another interesting framework for Function as a Service called <a href="https://www.iron.io/" title="iron.io">iron.io</a> and I am willing to try it as soon as possible so stay tuned!</p>

  <p>In times of experimenting, I am now having a lot of fun with docker, rkt, kubernetes and containers ecosystem in general. But one thing I never forget to play with is content editing and publishing! So here I am, trying to migrate all my blog and website to Hugo :)</p>
<p>So instead of a bare VPS I am moving my blog to AWS S3 + Cloudfront CDN. This will be more scalable and far less expensive. And Hugo generates static HTML so no more patching security issues.</p>

<h5 id="migrate-contents">Migrate contents</h5>
<p>First I found that there is a page on Hugo site that explains how to migrate from any CMS know to human to Hugo. I used the wordpress export plugin to convert the site from Wordpress to markdown and make it work ith Hugo: it did the the job pretty well but still I had to convert some of the posts.</p>
<h5 id="https">HTTPS</h5>
<p>Then the hard part: HTTPS! I chose to use <a href="http://letsencrypt.org" title="lestencrypt">letsencrypt</a> to automate the TLS certificate handling. The powerful <a href="https://github.com/xenolf/lego" title="lego">lego</a> is way more multi-platform than the official certbot from EFF written in Python, and has built-in support for DNS challenge on Route53! Generating a new certificate of renewing is <a href="https://gist.github.com/inge4pres/597bb9350ff3e9cc43ecb476a10e636b" title="gist">a couple of commands away</a>.</p>

  <h1><a href="https://inge.4pr.es/post/2016-09-18-a-benchmark-of-aws-efs/">A benchmark of AWS EFS</a></h1>
  <p>Amazon Web Services <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Elastic File System<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has been to my knowledge the service to have the longest beta testing period: reason for this may be that not as many client as expected tested it and AWS received too few feedback on it or that there were issues not to release GA. I don’t want to speculate on which one is correct but now that it has been <!-- raw HTML omitted -->officially released<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I decided to give it a try and of course compare it to a self-managed solution on the same platform.</p>
<p>If you followed AWS evolution you may agree that EFS has been introduced to fill the gap between EBS storage and S3: before EFS was live there was no “easy” way of having a distributed file system in AWS, you could only <!-- raw HTML omitted -->set up your own<!-- raw HTML omitted --> using  a combination of EC2 instances mounting Elastic Block Storage volumes and S3. Now with EFS you can have a AWS-managed distributed file system to be used in your cloud environment or even across the internet (will try that on a public subnet) with all the benefits of offloading the high-availability and replication burden to Amazon, and at a reasonable price. Will performance be enough compared to a self-managed solution?</p>
<h5 id="playground">Playground</h5>
<p>I use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->terraform<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to create an infrastructure template to run the tests, you can see it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Once</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>has finished, you’ll end up with:</p>
<ul>
<li>An EFS with General Purpose performance mode</li>
<li>An EFS mount target for 1 Availability Zone</li>
<li>1 EC2 instance named “client” to mount remote file systems</li>
<li>2 EC2 instances named “server_X” each one with a 10 GB General Purpose EBS, they will serve a self-managed distributed, replicated file system</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the terraform output and the steps to run on the 2 server nodes to have a running GlusterFS replicated volume; to configure the NFS export on server1, I used <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this guide<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>On the client I mount the EFS target with NFS4.1, the GlusterFS volume from the server <em>in the same subnet</em> via the GlusterFS native client_ _and the NFS export on the client’s designated mount points. I use the server on the same subnet as the client is, because the EFS target exposes a mount point in the same subnet and latency is a key factor in remote file system.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h5 id="benchmark-tests">Benchmark Tests</h5>
<p>I used <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fio<!-- raw HTML omitted --> installed on the client box with a command suggested by this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BinaryLane post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and run it against the mount point for EFS, GlusterFS and NFS v4.0 with the following command</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>changing the target directory each time I tun the test; each test is run isolated.</p>
<p>I did not customize any storage option for GlusterFS or NFS, so I’m using the default options.</p>

<h6 id="nfs-40-not-replicated">NFS 4.0 (not replicated)</h6>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h6 id="pricing-considerations">Pricing considerations</h6>
<p>EFS pricing is linear, you get billed a fixed amount for GB/month; this is not true with a self-managed cluster where you can surely reach higher performance, but the TCO is increasing every time you add capacity. If you’re not satisfied with EFS throughput you need a dedicated team to  manage a distributed file system cluster and its operations and maintenance.</p>
<h6 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h6>
<p>If you need a stable, realiable file system in AWS to be shared between EC2 instances, go and use EFS and don’t reinvent the wheel: GlusterFS is outperformed in both read and write IOPS and bandwith with the default options! The workload simulated here is showing poor write performance, so if your use case is a lot of concurrent writes on many files, consider another solution. A good workload could be a WORM (Write Once Read Many) share for permanent stored contents (images, archives?).</p>
<p>The performance are still low in absolute terms or compared to a non-replicated mount such as a stock NFS v4.0 server without the high-availability burden, but if you don’t care about 100% uptime you should definitely set up NFS with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DRDB<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to a secondary node, and switch your mounts when the primary node fails. But still: why manage all of this if AWS can do it for you?</p>

  <h1><a href="https://inge.4pr.es/post/2016-01-24-implement-a-generic-data-list-structure/">Implement a generic data list structure</a></h1>
  <p>As a coding challenge I was asked to provide a generic list implementation using a language of my choice and using only primitive types, avoiding the use of high level built-ins. I chose <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Go<!-- raw HTML omitted --> because I want to learn it and I know it can be useful to create an abstract, generic implementation.</p>
<p>The challenge request to implement at least 4 methods on the generic type:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filter() –  returns a subset of the List satisfying an operation</li>
<li>Map() – returns the List objects’ map</li>
<li>Reverse() – reverse the ordering of the List objects</li>
<li>FoldLeft() – join the objects from left to right using a join character</li>
</ul>
<p>As a bonus question I was asked to code unit tests for the aforementioned methods and give an explanation on how the implementation guarantees concurrent access on resources.</p>
<p>So here is my implementation: the type List has only one attribute, an array of type <code>interface{}</code></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Every type will be convertible to the <code>interface{}</code> type, but as Golang has strong types the conversion is not implicit and must be declared.</p>
<p>Reverse() will create a new array of <code>interface{}</code> to hold the reversed list</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Map() returns the List elements’ array, so it can be accessed as a whole</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This two function types will help define a custom operation to be used in Filter() and FoldLeft(): <!-- raw HTML omitted -->functions are types<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in Go and this enable a great level of abstraction.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Filter() will use a filter function, without the need to define it (!), and return a portion of the List data array.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>FoldLeft() will use a fold function, again not yet defined, the return a single element made of the entire list.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You can find all the code <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, any comment is welcome on how to improve the abstraction or efficiency of the implementation.</p>
<p>The opportunity to dig into the language ability to abstract is a very helpful way to better understand the language itself, so this coding challenge was a great opportunity to learn a little bit more Go!</p>

  <p><strong>[TL;DR]</strong></p>
<p>I wrote a Pub/Sub message queue in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Go<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, branch “master” is stable but missing some interesting feature like distributed memory synchronization between nodes in a cluster and encryption. Code at</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://github.com/inge4pres/gmq">https://github.com/inge4pres/gmq</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Being a cloud system engineer, my work is to design and implement distributed systems: one of the key principles in designing such architectures is <em>decoupling</em>, which means ensuring the many parts composing the system are able to share informations and complete a sequence of operations without being tied together. You can read more about cloud architectures and decoupling here.</p>
<p>One of the most common scenario in a cloud application is a series of asynchronous operations executed by many nodes on different layers: for example a front end server tier receiving  files and a backend server tier doing analysis on them; a good practice is to have a message queue between the two serving as an orchestration component. Each web server node will post a message in the queue for every files received, each backend node will consume a message from the queue to complete his operations on the files. In this way the two tiers are independent one from each other: in case of backend failure or over-capacity, the web servers will keep receiving files and storing message in the queue. If the two operations where done synchronously, the backend failure would stop the whole system to work.</p>
<p>A lot of <em>off-the-shelf</em> message queue software is already available, but I felt like writing my own would give me a good point of view on system programming with Go, so I wrote it, and the result is pretty awesome too. In a few days I was able to have a configurable message queue storing messages in memory, on filesystem or database (MySQL); communication is based on JSON via TCP, and the server can be configured to support a maximum number of queues, a maximum message length and queue capacity: combination of the configured parameters will have performance effects on the single node.</p>
<p>The roadmap of “develoment” branch is:</p>
<ul>
<li>adding cluster mode</li>
<li>adding memory synchronization in cluster mode</li>
<li>adding encryption: TLS over TCP</li>
<li>adding client authentication</li>
</ul>
<p>As you may have guessed from the above list, security of GMQ is not implemented at the moment, be careful!</p>
<p>Feel free to try it out and give suggestions!</p>
<p>Cheers 😀</p>

  <p>It is true: I fell in love with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Go<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, not because I love Google and his products, but because it really fits my ideology of simplicity and power in a programming language. I started experimenting with the language and thank to his web-oriented approach I quickly came up with one of the simplest single task web application I could write: a URL shortener.</p>
<p>What is a URL shortener? It’s a service that will give you a short link for a long URL.</p>
<p>Why should I use it? A short URL is easier to remember and to copy and paste, it lets you write more on social media where characters are limited (Twitter).</p>
<p>Why writing one when there are plenty of them already? Other shortener have an expiration date on short links, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4pr.es<!-- raw HTML omitted --> doesn’t!</p>
<p>Take a look at the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->code<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and you’ll see it is very simple: it takes a URL as text input filed of a form</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>generates a random string of 6 charachters, checking that the string is not in the database</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>and keep the URL – string association in the database for further redirection; once the random short URL is visited the client gets redirected to the origianl long URL!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So please try it and if you have any suggestion to increase performance or security please let me know!</p>

  <h1><a href="https://inge.4pr.es/post/2012-10-05-universita-facolta-di-psicologia/">Università: facoltà di psicologia</a></h1>
  <p>In Italia abbiamo molti problemi, ma l’ultimo dei nostri problemi era l’istruzione che vantava uno dei primi posti al mondo fino a pochi anni fa. Ora invece il declino strutturale del nostro Paese ha colpito anche questo settore che era di valore. Parlo di mancanza di fondi per università e ricerca, di formazione non orientata al lavoro e tutto ciò che ne consegue: l’aumento della disoccupazione giovanile e della sfiducia nel futuro è preoccupante perché è nella stesso ordine di grandezza di stati molto indietro rispetto alla media europea.</p>
<p>Per fortuna l’Italia è nota per le sue particolarità e anche in questo caso voglio esaltare un esempio di eccellenza di cui sono venuto a conoscenza per puro caso: pochi giorni fa infatti ho preso i mezzi per andare a seguire un lavoro fuori ufficio (evento più che raro) e durante il viaggio di ritorno ho incontrato la sorella di un’amica d’infanzia. Maddalena è parecchio cresciuta dall’ultima volta che l’avevo vista, si è laureata in psicologia clinica da un anno ed è in procinto di finire il praticantato che le permetterà di fare l’esame di stato e raggiungere l’abilitazione alla professione. Senza stare a discutere di questo ulteriore scempio di tempo (12 mesi in cui, per prassi, non si percepisce stipendio) imposto dalla legge italiana, voglio raccontare di quale coincidenza abbia voluto che proprio il giorno precedente mia sorella mi avesse dichiarato “mi piacerebbe  fare psicologia all’università”. Parlando mi ha spiegato che il corso universitario è diverso da come ce lo si aspetta: al primo anno ci sono molti esami scientifici, che sono un vero e proprio scoglio per le matricole, con conseguente scrematura degli iscritti; il “divertimento” per gli appassionati inizierà dal terzo anno e culminerà con la tesi.</p>
<p>Maddalena è stata tanto gentile da darmi il permesso di mettere a disposizione di chi volesse informarsi sulla facoltà di psicologia una presentazione che lei stessa ha scritto per degli alunni del liceo: la trovate allegato in fondo al post. Il contenuto è sua proprietà intellettuale. Questi sono gli esempi da cui tutti dovrebbero prendere ispirazione: dedicare del tempo a divulgare informazioni su un corso universitario aiuta molto chi deve fare una scelta importante come quella dell’università.</p>
<p>Grazie Maddalena</p>

  <p>Stamattina ho lavorato all’Arena Civica di Milano come tecnico del suono. La manifestazione che ho seguito era la cerimonia di chiusura del Ramadan islamico, l’equivalente della Pasqua cristiana. La cerimonia di per sè è stata breve, circa un’ora, ed è stato affascinante assistere a una manifestazione religiosa a cui non avevo mai assistito prima. Il programma è stato il seguente:</p>
<ul>
<li>raduno dei fedeli nel campo dell’Arena</li>
<li>presentazione dei celebranti del rito</li>
<li>preghiera</li>
<li>sermone</li>
<li>sfollaggio</li>
</ul>
<p>Innanzitutto ciò che mi ha colpito è stata la mole di persone che erano presenti: circa 15000 tra uomini donne e bambini; da notare che la religione islamica non conta solo fedeli dal medio oriente, gran parte infatti erano di origine africana e indonesiana. La seconda cosa che mi ha pietrificato è stata che all’inizio dei canti, un inserviente della comunità musulmana mi è venuto a chiedere di avere dei microfoni per la platea. Normalmente alle funzioni religiose è chi celebra che diffonde l’audio verso la folla, mentre loro mi chiedevano addirittura di zittire durante i canti il loro “parroco” perchè non aveva una bella voce! Stupito, e un po’ impaurito di commettere un errore, ho comunque eseguito l’ordine e il risultato è stato apprezzatto perfino dal parroco stesso. Il momento più solenne e sicuramente il più spettacolare è stato quello della shallah: è una preghiera liturgica, che è intonata dal loro “vescovo” e a cui tutta la folla risponde in coro, rigorosamente in arabo. E qui ho avuto la terza sorpresa: qualunque musulmano prega in arabo, cioè non hanno una traduzione delle loro preghiere nelle altre lingue. Affascinante il fatto che nigeriani, bangra, e marocchini stessero intonando le stesse litanie in un’unica lingua: qualcosa di impensabile per altre religioni ampiamente diffuse nel mondo. I video della preghiera principale qui di seguito:</p>

<p>A chi non avesse mai visto una cerimonia del genere, consiglio di assisterci. A chi non avesse mai pensato a partecipare attivamente e concretamente nella vita dei propri simili, consiglio di rifletterci.</p>
