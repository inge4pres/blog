      <description>Yes! Yesterday I received an awesome email stating that I cleared the Certified Kubernetes Administrator exam! ðŸ˜Ž Here I want to report my experience in preparing and taking the exam, hopefully this info can help others Kubernetes practitioners get the certification too.
Preparation I consider myself lucky because for the past two years I had the chance to use Kubernetes working at lastminute.com; on top this on-the-job training I went through a lot of studying and practicing because the exam itself has a lot of content.</description>
