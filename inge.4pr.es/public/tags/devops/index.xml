      <description>Continuous Delivery should be a solved issue: the practice is well-defined and there is a plethora of tools implementing it with more or less peculiarities, but still many struggle implementing it. The dream of a perfect continuous deployment flow from the developer to the production environment with software quality gates based on automated tests is still alive in me, I tried and tried several times with multiple implementations on multiple platforms and never got to the point where I could say: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m done, this works exactly as I wanted&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Recently I received a mail pointing me to a post about DevOps culture and some anti-patterns and misconception on how to build and grow a DevOps culture in a company. Whoever like me works in the Enterprise (&amp;ldquo;the one with the big E&amp;rdquo; - Kelsey Hightower) knows that applying DevOps practices often is limited to the adoption of some tools or the creation of a &amp;ldquo;DevOps team&amp;rdquo; responsible of managing some continuous delivery pipeline.</description>
