      <description>A friend asked me if I was able to get back working a Windows 98 PC he had in his house; I have never done it so I said “sure I can!” just to have the opportunity to learn something new, and of course do a friend a favour.
My idea was to copy the whole PC and get it running on a virtual machine thus doing what I later discovered is called a “P2V” (Physical to Virtual); the result of which would have been a portable VM which I could then install in my friend laptop to have his old PC back.</description>
