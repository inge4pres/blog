      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m in the train back from GoLab 2018 and I am so happy that I attended this conference! It&amp;rsquo;s been definitely one of most beautiful con I have attended in Italy, with tremendous speakers from all over the globe like Filippo Valsorda, Eleanor McHugh, Ron Evans and Bill Kennedy among many others; I have to say the organizers were just perfect in everything from the venue setup to the workshop organization, as if the quality of the talks ware not enough.</description>

      <description>In the early days of Go the language was often tailored towards &amp;ldquo;system programming&amp;rdquo; due to its C-stlye syntax and ability to write high-performance applications. Few time after, Go adoption was starting to gain traction for distributed systems development and projects like etcd, docker and kubernetes revealed the power of the networking capabilities offered by the internals in the language. Along the way a lot of libraries have been built around the powerful primitives offered by Go but in my opinion there is not enough use literature around the Communicating Sequential Processes implementation available through channels and goroutines, they are not even widely used in the standard library.</description>

      <description>As a coding challenge I was asked to provide a generic list implementation using a language of my choice and using only primitive types, avoiding the use of high level built-ins. I chose Gobecause I want to learn it and I know it can be useful to create an abstract, generic implementation.
The challenge request to implement at least 4 methods on the generic type:
 Filter() – returns a subset of the List satisfying an operation Map() – returns the List objects’ map Reverse() – reverse the ordering of the List objects FoldLeft() – join the objects from left to right using a join character  As a bonus question I was asked to code unit tests for the aforementioned methods and give an explanation on how the implementation guarantees concurrent access on resources.</description>

      <title>Golang Message Queue: a simple TCP message bus</title>

      <description>[TL;DR]
I wrote a Pub/Sub message queue in Go, branch “master” is stable but missing some interesting feature like distributed memory synchronization between nodes in a cluster and encryption. Code at
https://github.com/inge4pres/gmqBeing a cloud system engineer, my work is to design and implement distributed systems: one of the key principles in designing such architectures is decoupling, which means ensuring the many parts composing the system are able to share informations and complete a sequence of operations without being tied together.</description>

      <description>It is true: I fell in love with Go, not because I love Google and his products, but because it really fits my ideology of simplicity and power in a programming language. I started experimenting with the language and thank to his web-oriented approach I quickly came up with one of the simplest single task web application I could write: a URL shortener.
What is a URL shortener? It’s a service that will give you a short link for a long URL.</description>
