# Work experiences

#### Nov 2021 - now()  » Senior Software Engineer
##### [Elastic Observability](https://elastic.co/observability)
When Optimyze [joins forces with Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-and-optimyze-join-forces-to-deliver-always-on-continuous-profiling-of-infrastructure-applications-and-services),
I keep working with the same wonderful team, with the goal of integrating Prodfiler into the Elastic stack.
Prodfiler is now Universal Profiling: the same amazing technology, backed by a different data store.

I focus on the backend integration and data collection, trying to improve storage efficiency and keep continuous profiling
affordable. I also keep improving and supporting the integration of our continuous profiler with various orchestration platforms (Kubernetes, Nomad, ECS).

#### Jun 2020 - Nov 2021  » Senior Software Engineer
##### [optimyze.cloud](https://optimyze.cloud/)
We are a startup building Prodfiler: the lowest-overhead, always-on continuous-profiling tool for all your software stacks.
Prodfiler gives a holistic view of CPU consumption across all your fleets, supporting multiple platforms and languages.
I contribute to the product and leverage my previous working to bake reliability into our product and architectural decisions.

Our SaaS product goes GA on August 2021, being the first product of its kind to be available on the market.
The platform was built on Kubernetes with a focus on performance and reliability.

#### Sep 2018 - Jun 2020  » Site Reliability Engineer 
##### [lastminute.com](https://technology.lastminute.com/ "lastminute.com tech blog") 
I join the SRE team within Platform to work more closely on the company cloud platforms both on-premise and in public clouds.

Contributing mainly to the development of a CI/CD platform to enable developers to test, build and deploy software with ease and confidence; we are part of the Platform area and we collaborate with SREs and DBAs to provide developers automated services to consume infrastructure. 
The end-user platform runs on Kubernetes and we leverage Jenkins and Docker containers to shorten the development feedback loop and continuously improve product quality.
Here I have the opportunity to sharpen my software engineering skills growing the use of TDD practices and adopting SOLID design principles, developing in Groovy, Java and Go.

My job is to manage and maintain the IT infrastructure serving the core-business services both on-premise and on the 
AWS cloud platform. 
Daily activities span from infrastructure event monitoring to middleware and application deployments. 
In 2012, I started developing backend software for the company, evolving the existing J2EE stack.
In 2014, I introduced Go in the company primarily for systems programming: I created a software to manage AWS resources,
with a web GUI to help other departments in the company onboard the new AWS experience.
Terraform was not yet available.
