      <description>During the last years I’ve been experimenting with GlusterFSand his functionalities as distributed object store; a lot has changed in the software, overall since Red Hat acquired it. I have been using it and find it useful for many projects but not for others: what I love is the community oriented approach with a very responsive team and support for any kind of users (meaning from the 2 nodes web server to a RAID10 Infiniband cluster for high end storage).</description>
