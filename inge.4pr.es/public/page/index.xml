      <description>Bio I&amp;rsquo;m a passionate technology enthusiast, a Systems Engineer in love with Cloud Computing and a part-time musician and writer; I became a Go developer on 2013 when approaching distributed systems. I like to study how things work, understand the mechanics of technology products. In my spare time I play drums, bass guitar and acoustic guitar, and sometimes try and write some music; writing small poems is also interesting to me, as it helps me find a different meaning for anything I see.</description>
