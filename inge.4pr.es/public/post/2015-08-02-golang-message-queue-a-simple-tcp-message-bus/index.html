  <h1>Golang Message Queue: a simple TCP message bus</h1>
  <p><strong>[TL;DR]</strong></p>
<p>I wrote a Pub/Sub message queue in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Go<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, branch ‚Äúmaster‚Äù is stable but missing some interesting feature like distributed memory synchronization between nodes in a cluster and encryption. Code at</p>

<p>Being a cloud system engineer, my work is to design and implement distributed systems: one of the key principles in designing such architectures is <em>decoupling</em>, which means ensuring the many parts composing the system are able to share informations and complete a sequence of operations without being tied together. You can read more about cloud architectures and decoupling here.</p>
<p>One of the most common scenario in a cloud application is a series of asynchronous operations executed by many nodes on different layers: for example a front end server tier receiving¬† files and a backend server tier doing analysis on them; a good practice is to have a message queue between the two serving as an orchestration component. Each web server node will post a message in the queue for every files received, each backend node will consume a message from the queue to complete his operations on the files. In this way the two tiers are independent one from each other: in case of backend failure or over-capacity, the web servers will keep receiving files and storing message in the queue. If the two operations where done synchronously, the backend failure would stop the whole system to work.</p>
<p>A lot of <em>off-the-shelf</em> message queue software is already available, but I felt like writing my own would give me a good point of view on system programming with Go, so I wrote it, and the result is pretty awesome too. In a few days I was able to have a configurable message queue storing messages in memory, on filesystem or database (MySQL); communication is based on JSON via TCP, and the server can be configured to support a maximum number of queues, a maximum message length and queue capacity: combination of the configured parameters will have performance effects on the single node.</p>
<p>The roadmap of ‚Äúdeveloment‚Äù branch is:</p>
<ul>
<li>adding cluster mode</li>
<li>adding memory synchronization in cluster mode</li>
<li>adding encryption: TLS over TCP</li>
<li>adding client authentication</li>
</ul>
<p>As you may have guessed from the above list, security of GMQ is not implemented at the moment, be careful!</p>
<p>Feel free to try it out and give suggestions!</p>
<p>Cheers üòÄ</p>
