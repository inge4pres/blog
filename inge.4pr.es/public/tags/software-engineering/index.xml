      <description>I have been using micro-committing for some time now, during which I have adapted the usage of this technique to my needs, bringing it to a level that makes me more productive than ever in software development.
Combining micro-committing with Git, while doing TDD is now my favorite development experience: I like how this workflow helps to deliver changes with speed and confidence.
This is not a one-size-fits-all approach, I&amp;rsquo;m sharing what works great for me; I hope some parts of what follows will help you and your team as well.</description>
